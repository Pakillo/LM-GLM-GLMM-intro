## Linear, Generalized, and Mixed/Multilevel models with R

### Course philosophy

Introductory statistics are typically taught as a sequence of disconnected tests and protocols (e.g. t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, regression) while, in reality, all these analyses can be seen as special cases of a more general linear model. In this course, we will introduce Generalised Linear Models as a unified, coherent, and easily extendable framework for the analysis of many different types of data, including Normal (Gaussian), binary, and discrete (count) responses, and both categorical (factors) and continuous predictors.
